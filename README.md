# InvertedPendulumApp
GUI created in Appdesigner, application uses Matlab Control Toolbox to plot state variables and calculate control system parameters.

.mlapp files can be successfully read only when opened in Matlab.  Application was created and works as intended in Matlab 2018b. Compatibility with future Matlab versions is highly probable but not guaranteed. Copy of .mlapp code has been also added in .txt format for user's convenience and for anyone without Matlab to view. User's manual is available at the end of 'Raport.pdf' file in Polish language.
