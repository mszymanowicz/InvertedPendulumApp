# InvertedPendulumApp
GUI created in Appdesigner, application uses Matlab Control Toolbox to plot state variables and calculate control system parameters.

.mlapp files can be successfully read only when opened in Matlab.  Application was created and works as intended in Matlab 2018b. Compatibility with future Matlab versions is highly probable but not guaranteed. Copy of .mlapp code has been also added in .txt format for user's convenience and for anyone without Matlab to view. User's manual is available at the end of 'Raport.pdf' file in Polish language.

Results given by the application were reviewed by university professor and the project got the highest mark possible. I am aware that there is a lot of room for improvement and I intend to rewrite the application in Python in the near future for better performance and customized graphic elements.
